# React Interview Prep

Advanced React course for senior engineers. Each lesson covers what you need to explain and demonstrate in an interview, with optional deeper dives and cheat sheets for quick reference.

> **For TypeScript engineers with 10+ years experience**: This skips the basics entirely. Assumes strong JS/TS fundamentals and production React experience.

## Content Per Lesson

Each lesson directory contains:

- **`README.md`** — Core interview knowledge. Concise, pattern-focused, interview-ready.
- **`deep-dive.md`** — Optional extended content. Internals, edge cases, advanced patterns.
- **`cheat-sheet.md`** — Quick reference card. Syntax, APIs, gotchas — scannable during prep.

## Interactive Demos

The Vite app (`npm run dev`) has interactive component demos for hands-on practice:

```bash
cd courses/react
npm install
npm run dev
```

Currently implemented: Lesson 02 (Custom Hooks) with useFetch and usePrevious demos.

## Study Strategy

**Quick prep (4-6 hours)**: Read the README.md for each lesson + review cheat sheets before the interview.

**Deep prep (12-16 hours)**: Work through all READMEs, then deep-dive.md for your weaker areas.

**During the interview**: Cheat sheets are designed to be scannable for quick refreshers.
