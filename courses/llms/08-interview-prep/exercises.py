Module 08: Timed Interview Challenges

Exercises designed to simulate real interview conditions. Each exercise has:
- A time limit (what you would get in an actual interview)
- Clear requirements
- Hints (use only if stuck)
- A test function to verify your solution

Rules:
- No external dependencies. Standard library only.
- Read the full docstring before starting the timer.
- Prioritize working code over perfect code.
- Talk through your approach before coding (even if alone).

Scoring yourself:
- Finished within time, all tests pass: Strong hire
- Finished within time, most tests pass: Hire
- Finished over time, tests pass: Needs practice
- Could not finish: Study the golden examples in examples.py

       - Stores conversation turns (role, content)
       - Has a max_turns limit; when exceeded, drops the oldest non-system turns
       - Always keeps the system prompt
       - Returns messages in the correct format for an LLM call

    2. Implement a stream_response function that:
       - Takes a list of "stream chunks" (simulating a streaming API)
       - Yields each chunk to the caller (generator pattern)
       - After the stream completes, returns the full assembled text
       - Handles a stream that ends with an error chunk gracefully

    3. Implement a chat_turn function that ties it together:
       - Takes user input and a ConversationMemory
       - Adds the user message to memory
       - "Calls" the LLM (use mock) and streams the response
       - Adds the assistant response to memory
       - Returns the full response text
