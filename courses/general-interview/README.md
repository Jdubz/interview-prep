# General Interview Techniques

Interview strategy, behavioral questions, and common technical topics for senior/staff-level engineering roles. Covers the non-coding dimensions that often determine the outcome at senior levels — communication, leadership narratives, and asking the right questions.

> **Perspective**: At 10+ years experience, interviews shift from "can you code?" to "can you lead, communicate, and make good decisions?" This course covers the meta-skills that complement your technical courses.

## Modules

### 01 — Interview Strategy
- Understanding the hiring loop: phone screen → technical → system design → behavioral → team match
- Researching companies effectively (product, tech stack, culture, challenges)
- Managing your interview pipeline (timing, pacing, leverage)
- Salary negotiation fundamentals (levels, bands, equity)
- Remote vs on-site interview differences

### 02 — Behavioral Interview Mastery
- STAR method refined: situation, task, action, **results with metrics**
- Building your story bank (8-12 prepared narratives)
- Common behavioral themes:
  - Conflict resolution and difficult conversations
  - Leading without authority / cross-functional influence
  - Handling ambiguity and making decisions with incomplete information
  - Failure, learning, and growth
  - Mentorship and growing other engineers
  - Shipping under pressure / trade-off decisions
- Tailoring stories to the company's values

### 03 — Technical Communication
- Explaining complex systems to non-technical stakeholders
- Whiteboarding effectively (structure, pacing, engagement)
- Thinking out loud: narrating your problem-solving process
- Asking clarifying questions (requirements, constraints, scale)
- Handling "I don't know" gracefully

### 04 — Questions to Ask Interviewers
- Engineering culture: "How do you handle tech debt prioritization?"
- Team dynamics: "What does the on-call rotation look like?"
- Growth: "What does the path from senior to staff look like here?"
- Product: "How do engineers influence product direction?"
- Process: "Walk me through how a feature goes from idea to production"
- Red flags to watch for in interviewer responses

### 05 — Common Technical Questions (Language-Agnostic)
- Data structures and algorithms refresher (senior-level focus)
- Big-O analysis: time and space complexity
- Concurrency: threads vs processes, deadlocks, race conditions
- Networking: HTTP/HTTPS, TCP/UDP, WebSockets, DNS
- Operating systems: processes, memory, file systems
- Security: OWASP top 10, auth patterns, encryption basics

### 06 — Coding Interview Patterns
- Sliding window, two pointers, BFS/DFS
- Dynamic programming (top-down vs bottom-up)
- Graph algorithms (shortest path, topological sort)
- Tree traversals and manipulations
- Hash maps for O(1) lookups
- Time management during live coding

### 07 — Take-Home & Live Coding Projects
- Structuring a take-home submission (README, tests, clean commits)
- Time management: scope appropriately for the time limit
- What reviewers actually look for (hint: not cleverness)
- Live pair programming: collaboration over performance
- Practice projects and exercises (see `projects/` directory)

### 08 — Negotiation & Closing
- Understanding total compensation (base, equity, bonus, benefits)
- Researching market rates (levels.fyi, Glassdoor, Blind)
- Competing offers and leverage
- Counter-offer strategies
- Evaluating offers beyond compensation (growth, team, product, culture)

## Projects

Practice exercises and past interview projects:

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [`plant-watering/`](projects/plant-watering/) | In-memory service design exercise — data structures, validation, clean code |

---

## Prerequisites
- Active job search or upcoming interviews
- Technical skills from other courses in this repo

## Status
**Scaffolded** — module outlines complete, content to be written. Plant watering exercise migrated.
